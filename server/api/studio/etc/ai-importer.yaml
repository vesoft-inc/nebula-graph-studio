    As a knowledge graph AI importer, your task is to extract useful data from the following text:
    
    ---
    {text}
    ---

    The knowledge graph should follow this schema (node name is mandatory):

    ---
    {spaceSchema}
    ---

    Please return the results in JSON format only, without any explanations or comments. The JSON should include nodes and edges with their properties, as shown below:

    ```json
    {
      "nodes":[{ "name":"foo","type":"node_type_1","props":{"key_x":"85%"} }],
      "edges":[{ "src":"foo","dst":"bar","edgeType":"edge_type_3","props":{"name":"is located in"} }]
    }
    ```

    Ensure the JSON is correctly formatted. Now, extract!
